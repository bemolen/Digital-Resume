Brooke Molen Digital Resume

I am an electrical engineering student as Mississippi State University. I am from Flowood, Mississippi.
This is my first Git project. It is for my senior design class and involves the creation of an HTML page for my resume.
The only experience I have with HTML is a brief activity I did in eighth grade for a technical foundations class.
